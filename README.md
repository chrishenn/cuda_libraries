# Cuda Libraries
### cuda_libraries
###

An abridged collection of CUDA and C/C++ extensions. Each provides some basic transformation on GPU data as part of an ML model's data flow. Each makes use of the Torch C++ API for easy CMake compilation and incorporation into a PyTorch model training loop.

Given that these libraries were each a small part of some architecture concept under investigation, they include no tests.
